Django Fundamentals - plurasight
by Reindert-Jan Ekker

This course teaches the basics of web development with the Django framework. 
It will teach you everything you need to become a productive Python web developer.

Course Overview:

So let me give you a short overview of what you can expect from this course. 
First, of course, I'll show you how to install Django and set up your development environment. 
We'll see how to start a new project and some projects called apps and the general layout of these. 
You'll also learn how to use Django scripts to manage these environments. 
I'll also have a look at the Settings file for your project. 
We'll see how to define model clauses and generate a database from that and how to use the model API to get data from and save data to the database. 
We'll also see how to work with relations between these models which correspond with database relations between tables. 
And we'll see how Django can generate an admin interface for your database. And of course, we'll learn about views and templates as wel. 
Now speaking of views, you'll learn how to map a URL to a view, how to handle HTTP requests, and generate responses, and how to use the more advanced features of forms and generic views. 
We'll also see how to write Django templates, which includes learning about the template syntax and the tags and filters you can use and how to actually pass any data into the template. 
Well so far, that's what I'd call the core of Django, but there's also some other topics we'll come across and those include how to unit test your code, how to put your web site into production, and how to use third-party packages in your Django projects. 
And that's basically it for this intro module. Let's go ahead with the next module and see how to install Django.
